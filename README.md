## Psiclone: Toolbox for Topological Flow Data Analysis using COT Representations

Psiclone is a Python library, which is under development, for Topological Flow Data Analysis (TFDA).

It is not public yet but free for academic use.
Please make a contact to me if you want an academic trial version of `psiclone`.
